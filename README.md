# Serenity
In this age of information, where words appear without discretion, the probability of encountering oneâ€™s own triggers and phobias has multiplied. To make this online sphere a safe space for everyone, it is of utmost importance that we create a mechanism by which potentially offensive and disturbing content is filtered without curbing freedom of speech. Supposedly harmless words can trigger panic attacks and anxiety attacks in people when they are related to personal traumas and phobias. Serenity provides its users an opportunity to customise the trigger words. This is useful since trauma and life experience varies from people to people. It also supports free speech as the content as a whole is not censored. Our project aims at reducing the anxiety and fear a majority of people with common or uncommon trigger words face when coming across new content or source materials. Serenity is a trustworthy companion for all its users and is our humble endeavour to make life a little bit easier for our struggling counterparts.

The UN development goals tackled were 
Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being  
Goal 10: Reduced Inequality.

# Architecture
We mainly used Flutter to build our project. The Web app is meant to give an insight to our project. From the user' perspective they can create an account to customize the trigger words, add their comfort music and alternatives. Detecting of the trigger words is handled by Chrome extension. For now it blurs out the trigger words/the paragraph (situation) that might lead to panick attacks and prompt a warning for the user to decide if he/she wants to continue browsing.
The languages used are dart, html, Javascript. Different chrome APIs such as Tabs, Storage etc. were used in the case of extension.
