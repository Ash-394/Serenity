# Serenity
Serenity is a web application created by the students of Government Engineering College, Thrissur that aims to make the online world a safe space for everyone. It reduces anxiety and panic attacks by blurring  content containing user inputted trigger words. The UN development goals tackled were 
Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being  
Goal 10: Reduced Inequality.

# Architecture
We mainly used Flutter to build our project. The Web app is meant to give an insight to our project. From the user' perspective they can create an account to customize the trigger words, add their comfort music and alternatives. Detecting of the trigger words is handled by Chrome extension. For now it blurs out the trigger words/the paragraph (situation) that might lead to panick attacks and prompt a warning for the user to decide if he/she wants to continue browsing.
The languages used are dart, html, Javascript. Different chrome APIs such as Tabs, Storage etc. were used in the case of extension.
